#🔍 Anomaly Detection using CNN & One-Class SVM

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and One-Class SVM for anomaly detection. It helps detect defective products without needing images of defective samples for training.
#🚀 Project Overview

    Feature Extraction: Uses ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet) to extract deep features.
    Anomaly Detection: Implements One-Class SVM (OC-SVM) to classify images as normal or defective.
    Evaluation: Allows testing on new images for anomaly detection.
    Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to display results.

#📊 Results Visualization

    The script will display the image and classification result (Normal ✅ or Defective ❌).
    Feature vectors are saved for debugging.

#🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

    Python
    TensorFlow / Keras (CNN Feature Extraction)
    OpenCV / PIL (Image Processing)
    Scikit-learn (One-Class SVM)
    Matplotlib (Visualization)
